# NeuralNetwork
## Description
NeuralNetwork is trained by the error back propagation algorithm and determines the image with high accuracy.
## Images for training

## Input image with noise
![input_noise](https://github.com/Dan-Sad/NeuralNetwork/blob/master/NeuralNetwork/imgForGit/InputImgsWithNoise.png)
## Result
The graph shows that the Neural network is learning fast.

If you submit the first picture (1;0;0;0), then the accuracy is 0.896, and if the fourth picture, then the accuracy is 0.796.
